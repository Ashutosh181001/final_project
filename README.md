# Final Year Project Repository - Anglia Ruskin University

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my final year project at Anglia Ruskin University. This repository is a comprehensive archive of all the Jupyter notebooks and relevant datasets used in my research. The project is an in-depth analysis combining event data with betting data to understand patterns and predictions within football matches.

## Repository Contents

- **Event Dataset Processing**: Notebooks dedicated to processing and analyzing the raw events data from football matches.
- **Betting Dataset Processing**: Notebooks that handle the processing of betting data obtained for this project.
- **Merging Datasets**: Scripts and notebooks that demonstrate how the event dataset was merged with the betting dataset to create a unified analysis framework.
- **Data Analysis**: Notebooks that contain exploratory data analysis, providing insights and identifying patterns within the combined dataset.
- **Model Building**: The core of the project, where predictive models are built and evaluated based on the processed and merged datasets.

## Datasets

### Event Dataset

Due to size constraints, the full football events dataset is not hosted in this GitHub repository. However, it is essential for replicating the research conducted as part of this project. The dataset can be found at the following location:

[Events Dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0247-7)

To refine and process this raw events data, a zip file named `metadata_event_dataset.zip` is included in this repository. This metadata is crucial for understanding and refining the raw event data.

### Betting Dataset

The betting dataset used in this project can be obtained by creating a free account on the BetFair website. For the purposes of this research, the data was selected with the following criteria:

- **Period**: August 2017 to May 2018
- **Market Type**: Match Odds
- **League**: English Premier League

This dataset is instrumental in analyzing betting trends and odds in conjunction with football match events.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or build upon the research conducted in this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the event dataset from the provided Nature link.
2. Obtain the betting dataset from BetFair by creating a free account and selecting data according to the criteria mentioned above.
3. Use the provided Jupyter notebooks to process both datasets, merge them, and conduct your analysis or model building.

## Acknowledgments

This project would not have been possible without the extensive dataset provided by Nature and the betting data accessibility through BetFair. Special thanks to my supervisor Dr Lakshmi Babu Saheer at Anglia Ruskin University for their guidance and support throughout this research.
